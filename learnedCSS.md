# Web Developer Study
## 12 months web developer study. I decided to dedicate at least 12 months to learn web development.

* Online courses, challenges and creation of my own projects.

## What I learned/used 
### CSS 
* Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) 
    * internal css
    * external css
    * link CSS file
    * mobile version -> < meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    * < article> -> article elements commonly contain multiple elements that have related information.
    * width
    * margin
    * padding
    * background-color
    * background-image
    * img 
    * display
    * class
    * id
    * Colors -> It's better practice to choose one color as the dominant color, and use its complementary color as an accent to bring attention to certain content on the page.
    * Colors
        * rgb
        * hex -> With hex colors, 00 is 0% of that color, and FF is 100%. So #00FF00 translates to 0% red, 100% green, and 0% blue, and is the same as rgb(0, 255, 0).
        * hsl -> The CSS hsl function accepts 3 values: a number from 0 to 360 for hue, a percentage from 0 to 100 for saturation, and a percentage from 0 to 100 for lightness.
        * rgba -> rgba(redValue, greenValue, blueValue, alphaValue);
        * gradient -> A gradient is when one color transitions into another. The CSS linear-gradient function lets you control the direction of the transition along a line, and which colors are used.
            * linear-gradient(gradientDirection, color1, color2, ...);
            * Color-stops allow you to fine-tune where colors are placed along the gradient line. They are a length unit like px or percentages that follow a color in the linear-gradient function.
        * opacity -> With the value 0, or 0%, the element will be completely transparent, and at 1.0, or 100%
        * alpha channel -> alpha channel controls how transparent or opaque a color is. add an alpha channel to the other CSS color properties.
    * border
    * box-shadow -> property lets you apply one or more shadows around an element.
        * box-shadow: offsetX offsetY color;
        * blurRadius ->  box-shadow: offsetX offsetY blurRadius color;
        * spreadRadius -> box-shadow: offsetX offsetY blurRadius spreadRadius color;
    * form
        * label
        * input
        * required
        * minlength
        * pattern="[a-z0-5]{8,}"
    * pseudo-element
        * hover
        * active
        * visited
        * last-of-type
    * width of unset. -> This will remove the earlier rule which set all the input elements to width: 100%.
    * attribute selector -> selects an element based on the given attribute value
        * input[name="password"]
    * box-model -> In the CSS box model, every HTML element is treated as a box with four areas.
