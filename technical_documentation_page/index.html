            <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of
                language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended
                for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its
                    Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
                    elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page
                    navigation.</li>
                <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript
                    on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
                    database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or
                    perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
                <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
                <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the
                    main page about JavaScript.</li>
            </ul>

            <header>JavaScript and Java</header>
            <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript
                language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript
                follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the
                reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Hello_world">
            <header>Hello world</header>
            <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript
                code:</p>
            <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); } <br> greetMe("World");</code>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
            <header>Variables</header>
            <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent
                characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the
                characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Declaring_variables">
            <header>Declaring variables</header>
            <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
            <code>var x = 42.</code>
            <p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.</p>
            <code>x = 42.</code>
            <p>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this
                variant.</p>
            <code>let y = 13.</code>
            <p>This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Variable_scope">
            <header>Variable scope</header>
            <p>JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within
                a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the
                following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is
                declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.</p>
            <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
            <p>This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.</p>
            <code>if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is
                not defined</code>
            <p></p>
